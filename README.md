## :yum: Introduction this project
這份作業是ACV(高等電腦視覺)，我使用C++及opencv來撰寫。

This assignment is ACV (Advanced Computer Vision), I use C++ and opencv to write.

## :books: Source
1. Opencv4.4.0
2. Visual Studio 2019
3. Opencv_world440d.dll

## :warning:嚴禁抄襲
這些只是提供我自己的想法而已，程式碼撰寫得也沒有到很嚴謹，禁止抄襲。

These are just to provide my own ideas, and the code is not written very rigorously. I hope that there will be no plagiarism.
